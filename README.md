As shown in the above image, the red bugs must not fall into the bucket while also catching the falling brown eggs. You should try to catch as many as eggs as you can during the play so as to earn the highest profit ;).

But oooh!! What will happen if you drop an egg. Don't worry your boss won't scold at you for missing them, but he may scold you for making the floor dirty as the fallen eggs will leave splash behind. And also as you catch the eggs, your score, which reflects the extra tip you will be getting, increases. And definitely you would like to have as high score as possible.

See the player, who was unluckyly was me :\ , dropped an egg and it created a splash over the ground. Now, I am fearing of my boss. And that's why I am making you aware you of this so that you do not land into this condition. 

OOOhhhh!!! There is one more thing I will have to tell you and it is more important than the thing I told you previously. These red bugs have grown some interest in the eggs. If any bug finds a way to those eggs, it will spoil them in a blink of an eye. These red bugs are falling from the sky along with the eggs and if somehow get a bug in your bucket, then you are gone. Your boss spared you for missing the eggs, but this can get you in a serious trouble. If you catch a bug, your boss will fire you from your job. ### OR YOUR GAME WILL GET OVER.
